# AZ's WP SMTP Mailer

A lightweight WordPress plugin to configure custom SMTP settings for sending emails reliably via your chosen mail server.

## Why I Created This Plugin?

Most SMTP plugins available today are packed with features I didn’t need — and many of them collect usage data or add unnecessary bloat.

**AZ's WP SMTP Mailer** was built with a single goal:  
Just send emails, simply and reliably — with no extra fluff.

- No tracking
- No upsells
- No over-engineered dashboards

If you're looking for a lightweight SMTP solution that just works, this is it.
